# Animarker-21
Animarker 2021-2022 Version

In my Application AnimarkerV2 I have added a Splashscreen,
Nav Bar with menu that you can navigate between. I am able to add,
fields and Images. I am able to update my image if I change my mind.
I can also list these images on the list page. I have added persistence
where my info is saved in json form. I added a star rating feature that
doesn't fully function but it is a nice visual feature.
I have a Datepicker added for visual effect.

UX/ DX APPROACH ADOPTED

For UX I made my buttons bigger and font size bigger so that
users of any age will be able to both tap and read. I tried to
have a logical positioning of buttons burger menus and so on.
I went for a gradient colour which I chose to design for myself
as a design because I wanted an interesting looking app but If
I was designing for others I would have used a very light basic colour
palette that is easier on the eyes. In terms of DX I found it very hard to
get my head around which methods to use and what can mix and cant mix.

GIT APPROACH
In terms of git I created two branches main and develop
I originally added to the main and then I created a develop
branch as I added more functionality. I merged my develop branch back into main.

PERSONAL STATEMENT.
Overall I found this Assignment very difficult.
I confused myself between all the different labs and
if I had time to start from scratch again I would take
a different approach. I had Firebase excepting email sign
up and then crashing so I left firebase out but I did have it functioning.
As you can see from photos below. Wish I could have gotten more functioning.
